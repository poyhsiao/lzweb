The WAN Detection table shows <b>Number of Requests</b>, <b>Number of Replies</b>, and <b>Success Ratio %</b> for each target IP listed in [System/WAN Detection/Target List]. Under circumstances of no disconnection, Success Ratio indicates the reliability of the IP, whether or not it is good for WAN Detection. IP addresses with high success ratio close to 100% are highly recommended.</td>
